**Contribution and Credit**
- Kevin Long (Instructor): Very helpful and patient with students throughout the entire Capstone. Increased my understanding of code overall. Although I was struggling with javascript Kevins example walkthrough of the project gave me the confidence i needed t try it on my own and better understand javascript.
- Thounny Keo (Colleauge): Gave me great advcie and help with some of the css in my project.
- Jalen Battle (Colleauge): Helped with Javascript funtioning of nav bar and css.

**My Point of View**
During this project I felt more confident in all my abilities although if I were to notice gaps I need to improve it would be in Javascript. In the beggining connecting the server wass a bit harder for me than creating the actual website, but Kevin's guidance helped me gain the understanading I needed.
